## Hello there 👋

We are very happy that you are interested in creating a Vue Storefront integration with us. We are committed to building a rich and diverse ecosystem, and your success in being part of it is also our success.

We would love to highlight every integration meeting our quality standards and promote it so your company is recognized as one of the leading solution integrators for Vue Storefront.

However, to promote your integration and list it as our recommended solution for a given platform, we need to ensure that it meets our high standards and that the community will have a positive experience using it. We divided our requirements into three sections to better illustrate and emphasize our definition of high quality.

Before we jump into the requirements, we want to highlight that not all requirements are set in stone, and we are happy to discuss them if you have any concerns. You can also count on our continued support in all of these areas, especially if you don’t have prior experience with some of them.

By committing to the standards and becoming our Open Source partner your company is becoming an official Vue Storefront Integration Maintainer. This comes with perks that will bring more recognition to your company and ensure good communication between you and us:

- Your company will be listed as Open Source partner on our website
- Your company logo will be visible at the top of integration GitHub repository and documentation to ensure everyone knows you're a maintainer
- The integration will be listed on our website and documentation
- You will be invited to the monthly VSF contributors meeting with VSF co-founder Filip Rakowski and be the first one to know about upcoming changes and have influence on them as a stakeholder.

On top of this, Vue Storefront commits to helping with:

- Doing marketing about the integration on our social media accounts and Discord server (audience of 12k+ developers)
- Joint case study to be featured on our blog (+16k visits per month)
- Webinar, which we’d help to promote, featuring strategic projects built by the partner

## Development 🛠️

We want our users to be able to easily find community-maintained integrations that are free of known security issues and are up-to-date with the rest of our ecosystem.

### Minimal requirements:

- Integration must be developed in a public repository in the [vuestorefront-community organization on GitHub](https://github.com/vuestorefront-community/). The repository can be private only until the first public release.
- Security fixes should be released within one week after the initial reporting. They should not be publicly disclosed until a patch is available. You also have to let the Vue Storefront team know about any such issue, so we can verify our other integrations. You can use our [SECURITY document](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/main/SECURITY.md) as a reference
- New updates should be published at least once every 3 months. These updates can be major-, minor-, or patch-level releases.
- Projects should be updated to the latest core no later than 1 month after the release.

## Documentation 📚

Our users have to be able to set up projects by themselves by following a written guide. Documentation should also include content describing integration-specific API, so there is no need to look up the source code to learn how certain features work.

### Minimal requirements:

- Documentation must be public.
- Content must include:
    - Installation guide.
    - Configuration guide.
    - Description, list of features, API, and usage examples for all composables.
    - Description and list of parameters for all API endpoints.
    - API reference.
    - Migration guides for every release.

### Nice-to-haves (facultative):

- How-to guides.
- Tutorial videos.

## Developer Experience 👩‍💻👨‍💻

For many developers, the initial Developer Experience can be a deciding factor when deciding whether or not to use Vue Storefront for the next project. That’s why we want them to have a positive experience and that the application works as expected.

### Minimal requirements:

- The project should be fully functional after following the Installation guide.
- At least 80% of all questions related to a given integration on Discord must be answered within 7 calendar days.

### Nice-to-haves (facultative):

- The API client and composables should have decent test coverage (70% +)
- Projects should have decent performance metrics out of the box (50+ Lighthouse score)
- Up-to-date demo
